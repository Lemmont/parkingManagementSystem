# Parking Management System
A Parking Management System that simulates a paid parking lot that keeps track of vehicles, the time they spend parking and what they owe the parking lot. 

### Goal
The goal of this program is to test my C++ skills, get to know the syntax and the infrastructure better. More precisely: object oriented programming, referencing classes from other files and memory management.

Furthermore, providing my Github with an additional project to show of my endeavor in becoming a better software developer. 

### Results
- Not completed with the program yet.
- Given my experience of C, which I obtained during my university program, C++ is a piece of cake and only a quick refresher was needed to get the hang of it. Hoping to do some more complex stuff in the future. 

### Simulation
This program runs based on a clock, where every hour of a day is a iteration. Eacht 24 step cycle is a labeled as a day. Each hour, a car can decide to enter or leave a parking lot. It does this based on the avaiable space in the parking lots, basing its decision on the most 'attractive' one. It prefers the parking lot with the most space left, skipping any other which may have space left but not as much as the favorite.
